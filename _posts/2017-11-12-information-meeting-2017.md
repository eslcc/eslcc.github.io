This year, we're holding another information meeting for anyone interested in joining the eslcc.
We're having the meeting on Tuesday 14 November, at 11:10, in room F011. At the meeting we'll aim to
explain our goals with the eslcc, what you can bring us, what we can bring  you, and how to apply.
Everyone's welcome, so if you think the eslcc might be a thing for you, join us on Tuesday.
And if you can't make it to the meeting, don't worry - we'll publish the details of the meeting right here on our blog.

We hope to see you there!
