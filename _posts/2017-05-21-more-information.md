Website
-------
Our domain name [eslcc.club](https://eslcc.club/) is registered until Dec 18, 2017 with [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)  
It works with cloudflare DNS to redirect to [eslcc.github.io](https://eslcc.github.io), where the actual website is hosted.  
Initially I bought the name for ~1€ and it came with free WhoisGuard, however none of these apply for extensions.  
Extending the registration for another year would cost €9,73 (for registration) + €0,16 (ICANN fee) + €2,58 (WhoisGuard) which makes €12,47.  
I am not planning to fund this once I am out of school, we will decide on the options next year.

Leadership
----------
<span class="author">@markspolakovs</span> and I have decided that it is optimal for the club to be run by two people at once - a president and his deputy (dual leadership mentioned in the last post).  
To maintain progression of the system, the roles will change every year - the president will become a normal member, the deputy will become the new president, and he will choose one member from the club to be the new deputy (this should not be the last president, only if there are no other candidates).  
Benefits of this system are that the president will always have 1 year of experience from beforehand and will be able to handle the club. He/she will also mentor the new deputy to help him/her out.  
Right now I am the president and Marks is the deputy.  
Next year, I will leave the school (unless I fail and repeat 7th year, but chances of that are virtually 0), Marks will become president and he will choose his deputy at the beginning of the school year. If you would like to be a candidate, let Marks know about it now already.  

Mentoring
---------
The members of eslcc are of approximately 3 categories: learners, workers and mentors (there may be many more methods of categorising).    
Learners are those who are not taking part in the club's main project yet (explained in the project board section), because they are still learning pre-requisite skills.  
Workers are those who are working on the club's main project.  
Mentors are those who help learners become workers, by teaching them necessary skills.  
Right now, me and Marks are the mentors: I teach by giving members tasks with HTML, Marks explains React. Marks and Alexandre Fouquet are workers and the rest are learners.  
Pursuing projects is the main goal of eslcc, therefore we hope to have more workers soon.  
Sharing knowledge is vital to increasing our ability and also helps with the earlier goal, therefore mentors are also highly desirable.  
Nevertheless, we truly respect learners too, for their work and dedication, and wish them luck.

Project board
-------------
The club has a project board, where all of our project ideas are, located in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/orgs/eslcc/projects/5).  
eslcc members will all be focused on one project at a time, at the time of writing, this project is [euroschool-app](https://github.com/eslcc/euroschool-app).  
Those who cannot participate due to lack of knowledge (the learners) are expected to learn independently, or with the help of mentors (based on preference and availability).  
From last blog post:
>It's also worth noting that it's not just the leadership that decides the direction of the club. Any member can propose a project, and we can discuss it


eslcc future
------------
The goal of the club, again, is to complete projects. These projects should be beneficial to the school and/or its students or the club.  
Through work, members gain experience and knowledge in programming, graphic design, team work and many other skills.  
I hope that in the future finished projects will be making everyone's lives easier, members will gain new opportunities from their affiliation with the club and eslcc will grow and improve.
